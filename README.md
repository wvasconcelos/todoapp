# Sample React App
By Will Davies Vasconcelos

To run the app, you must start the database server first, and then the client. 
To start the server, go to the server folder and then run: 
```
npm run dev
```
To start the client, open a new terminal, go to the client folder, then run: 
```
npm start
```

Note: The app will run in dev mode, on port 3000.
To access the app with a browser, use the following URL:
`http://localhost:3000`

You can access the app's data using GraphiQL, GraphQL's integrated development environment (IDE).
To do so, go to: 
`http://localhost:8000/graphql`
